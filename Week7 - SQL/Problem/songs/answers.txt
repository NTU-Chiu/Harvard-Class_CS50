If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
The average of energy and danceability and valence is 0.66 and 0.72 and 0.48.
I think this person like the songs for dance but less positity, which might indicate that their audio aura is purple and green.
Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The more measurement is needed. And it would be better to have more audio aura.
